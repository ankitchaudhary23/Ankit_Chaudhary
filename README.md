# [Project - Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/ankitchaudhary23/Machine_Learning_Engineer-Nanodgree/blob/master/01-boston-housing/README.md)
* The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes


# [Project - Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ankitchaudhary23/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/edit/master/README.md)

* The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

# [Project - WeRateDogs Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/ankitchaudhary23/Data_Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/04-data-wrangling)
** Data Wrangling: The dataset that I had worked for wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
** My goal: Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.



# [Project - Customer habits of Ford GoBike System in 2017 & 2018](https://github.com/ankitchaudhary23/Data_Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/05-data-visualization/project-05)

* Dataset: The data consist of approximately 2.38M bike rides from FY2017-2018. The attributes include the trip start/end time, start/end station, duration in seconds as well as additional information such as user type, gender, and birth date. 155K data points were removed from the analysis due to inconsistencies in the birth date, which in some cases was dated prior 1900. The data can be found [here](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data), with feature documentation available [here](https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data).

* Summary of Findings: There were 2.38M rides. 20-30 years old users are rapidly growing compared to other user groups. When the service first started 30-40 years old users were dominant, however 20-30 years old users became leader in a year. 20 to 40 years old people took the more than %70 of bike rides. Among those, 30 to 40 years old people's rides account almost 40% of all bike rides. Male took around 76% of all bike rides, and female took around 24% of them. People use this service on weekdays more than weekends. 8am and 5pm are the peak hours for this service. Also, people use this service when they are in lunch time as well. Percentage of subscribers is almost 88.15%. Percentage of customers is almost 11.85%. Customers' rides seems increasing slightly but subscibers' rides reached 6 times more than customers' on October 2018. There is a decrease on November 2018 for subscribers but it seems like it is related with winter season. Subscribers' average trip duration is around 11 minutes. Customers' average trip duration is around 28 minutes. Subscribers and customers trip distance were about the same, which is slightly more than one mile. 90% of bike rides take place on weekday. The peak bike rides time for all members is around commute time.Finally, it seems that 45 to 45 years old age group use the service the most.

* Key Insights for Presentation: For the presentation, I focus on the influence of age, timeframe, weekday, age group of bike hiring data. I start by introducing the age distrubition, monthly bike hiring trend, followed by age group distribution, then plot the weekday, timeframe with age data. I tried to use different color palettes for each variables to make sure it is clear and to ber interested that they're different between each other.
